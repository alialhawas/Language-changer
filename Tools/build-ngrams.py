"""Generate Dodoma's offline language models from open word-frequency data.

This is the ONLY part of the project that touches the network, and it only
does so on a developer machine when the raw lists are not already cached in
``Tools/data/`` (gitignored). The Swift app and its tests read exclusively
from the committed outputs under ``Sources/DodomaCore/Resources/``.

Outputs, all deterministic (rerunning over the same cache yields byte
identical files):

  en.words          top 40k normalised English words, lexicographic
  ar.words          top 40k normalised Arabic words, lexicographic
  en.bigrams.json   letter bigram log-probability table + score calibration
  ar.bigrams.json   ditto
  LICENSES.md       attribution for the source corpora

Usage:  uv run Tools/build-ngrams.py  [--force]
