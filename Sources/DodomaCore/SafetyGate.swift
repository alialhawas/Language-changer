///
/// ### Why the two accessibility checks fail in opposite directions
///
/// Both AX reads share one deadline and can time out. They then answer
/// differently on purpose:
///
/// - The **secure-field check fails open** (`.unknown` → carry on). Password
///   fields that matter almost always *also* enable secure event input, which
///   is checked separately, synchronously and without accessibility — belt one.
///   Failing this check closed would mean that any app slow to answer an AX
///   query is an app Dodoma refuses to work in, and the slow ones are the
///   Electron and web apps the product mostly exists for. The cost of failing
///   open is bounded by belt two.
/// - The **verify-before-delete check fails closed** (`.unknown` /
///   unreadable → downgrade to a suggestion). This is the one guarding the
///   destructive path, and a suggestion is a harmless outcome, so there is no
///   reason to gamble here.
