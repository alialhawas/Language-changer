///    after the misspelt word is part of `replacedText` and counted here.
/// 2. Deleting exactly `deleteCount` clusters removes exactly `replacedText`;
///    `deleteCount == replacedText.count`.
/// 3. Typing `insertText` afterwards leaves the caret where it started, in the
///    sense that any trailing whitespace in `replacedText` reappears at the end
///    of `insertText` — a space renders to a space under either layout, so the
///    user can keep typing the next word without retyping the separator.
